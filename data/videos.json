In the 1960s, the CIA and India’s Intelligence Bureau teamed up on a top-secret Cold War mission: to plant a nuclear-powered spy device on Nanda Devi to monitor China’s nuclear tests. But the mission went horribly wrong. The device — packed with 5 kilograms of plutonium — was LOST on the mountain… and has never been found.
